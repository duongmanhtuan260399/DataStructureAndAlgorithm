"QuickSort is generally the fastest (with random pivot id). MergeSort is stable O(n log n) though it is  slightly behind a well-pivoted QuickSort
-> For big inputs use QuickSort (median-of-three/random) or MergeSort; use Insertion Sort only for very small or nearly sorted arrays; avoid Selection and Bubble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
